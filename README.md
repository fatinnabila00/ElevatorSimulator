# ElevatorSimulator-
The project was about writing a program to simulate an elevator controller controlling a single elevator in a building. The elevator installed in the building is destination dispatch based, which means when a passenger issues a service request, the passenger will have to specify the destination, before the request is being accepted to allow room for more efficient scheduling.
